    "# Chance of generating ER from MMSBM given alpha\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate mmsbm graph we sample probabilities for each node to act as belonging to certain community. Therefore, if we assign the concentration for a Dirichlet distribution in such a way that the probability of all nodes to belong to the same community is really high, the graph will effectively look like an ER.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is shown what these mmvectors($i$ entry of each vector indicates probability of the node to belong to community $i$) look like for different values of alpha to determine the probability of deviation from ER given a 2-block network."
